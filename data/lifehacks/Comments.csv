Once the drink is cooled, the melting of the ice will slow considerably.  Since we can assume the cooling of the drink is to *consume* it, having ""more water"" in your ice does not mean more dilution. One might even argue that having a higher-density of ice will allow more cooling of the drink before the temperature elevates enough to melt it (i.e. ice from your freezer starts out at ~ 0°F (about -17°C)).

13837,9752,0,This looks interesting. Your P.S. about fixed materials around a window doesn't work because as soon as there is airflow there is some leakage of light around them. Nevertheless the idea of a partial canopy sounds promising -- the bed is against the wall so one side is taken care of. Airflow and its attendant  light leakage is still a problem with a canopy but it's worth some further thought. I suppose I could go for the full four-poster but that is more than I really want.,2015-10-20T22:17:06.107,9368,CC BY-SA 3.0,

Those bacteria are what form the brown foam. Water softener salt typically includes compounds to prevent their growth.

For these heat packs the problem isn't the metal. The metal is submerged and will dissipate the heat fast enough. But if you overheat the pack, even just a little, the steam pressure will burst it.

There is absolutely no possible physical way for you to shift into reverse at 30mph (and release the clutch) without causing catastrophic damage to the gearbox and, most likely, the engine as well. The car's behaviour would also be nothing like you describe. The drive wheels would _immediately_ lock up as the driveshaft(s) get caught in the mess of broken gears inside the gearbox.
