  <p>The profession of scribe was considered to be most honourable, and its rewards were great, for no rank and no dignity were too high for the educated scribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>E.A. Wallis Budge, <em>The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from
  language, because every natural science always involves three things:
  the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract
  concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which
  the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;
  to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and
  the same reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antoine Lavoisier, 1789</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[L]ogic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of
  the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of
  truth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the
  understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;
  that is, to contradict itself.</p>

<p>Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, I, 2nd Part, II. Of Transcendental Logic</p>

  than of his intellect.</p>

  If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That's the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

It’s worse what the new rules make of the language.</p>

<p>“Is it a CoC violation if I use they/them?” ⇒ ◆mod “You can use an ambiguous they if […] correct pronouns [are] unknown [to you]. Once someone tells you that they go by something else, switch to that something else.”</p>

<p>CoC: “Grammar concerns do not override a person’s right to self identify.”</p>

<p>The FAQ entry to that: “Do I have to use pronouns I’m unfamiliar or uncomfortable with (e.g., neopronouns like xe, zir, ne... )?” ⇒ “Yes, if those are stated by the individual.”</p>

<p>⇒ Not using unfamiliar is now grounds for being banned.</p>

<p>My main goals when designing and coding are: how can I make the user experience easiest, and how can I reduce redundancy.</p>

<p>Tim is a husband, father, blogger, RPG gamemaster, wargamer, homebrewer, OSS software geek, and independent thinker.</p>

<p>Tim won the <a href=""https://altdorfer.blogspot.com/2011/05/wfrp-best-of-fans-9.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2011 Best of the Fans</a> recognition by <a href=""https://altdorfer.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Altdorf Correspondent</em></a> for his 26 WFRP entries in the Blogging A to Z 2011 web event. He will use ""Award Winning"" from time-to-time to remind you of this recognition. Tim marked five years as participant of the Blogging A to Z web event, collaborating internationally with fans of Warhammer.</p>

<p>Tim's gaming grognard badges include managing an FLGS from 1986-1988, running <em>TMNT:OS</em>, <em>Twilight:2000</em> (being a child of the Cold War) and writing a <em>Twilight:2000</em> chargen in BASIC on a TRS-80 CoCo II, enjoying lots <em>WFRP</em> 1ed and <em>WH40K:Rogue Trader</em> in college, and refereeing a Shadowrun 1ed tournament at the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1990.</p>

<p>Tim can be found on StackExchange, lurking on <a href=""https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/2670/javafueled"">RPG</a>, <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/users/3467/javafueled"">homebrew</a>, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/289767/javafueled"">stackoverflow</a>, or on <a href=""https://untappd.com/user/javafueled"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Untappd</a> and <a href=""http://github.com/timothystone/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub</a>. Tim also asks that your profile be complete enough that he will be able to know that you like RPGs, OSS, and homebrewing too.</p>

<p>Tim's gaming interests include WFRP 1e and 2e, Twilight:2000, D&amp;D BECMI, 1e and 5e, and some others.</p>

<p>Tim's homebrewing experience is almost 20 years old—he doesn't subtract the 12 idle years between getting married and reigniting his passion in the hobby. He brewed <a href=""https://untappd.com/b/thirsty-stone-brewing-night-gaunt/1023546"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Night Gaunt</a> in 2015 for a local gaming con, uniting two hobbies. Annual batches of Night Gaunt have been brewed since.</p>

This blend of research and development is the type of work which motivates and excites me the most. Currently, I am working on <a href=""http://www.cachet.dk/research/research-projects/bhrp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a distributed platform which enables researchers to conduct biometric research</a> 'in the wild' (outside of the lab environment).</p>

<p>As part of my previous research, I developed a fully functional system (called <a href=""http://whatheco.de/laevo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laevo</a>), exploring an alternative to the prevalent, antiquated, desktop computing paradigm. This work (and related publications) contributes to a line of research called 'activity-centric computing'.</p>

<p>I have almost 10 years of professional software development experience. Prior to academia, I worked for several years as a professional full-stack software developer at a game development company in Belgium: <a href=""http://www.aimproductions.be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AIM Productions</a>. I immediately started working here after a successful internship concluding my bachelor degree (obtained in 2007). My job entailed working on interactive hometrainer software and other multimedia applications. This spiked my interest in user interface development. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=""https://www.uu.nl/en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands, from which I graduated in 2012.</p>

The collapse is now in full swing - it will complete in around 12-18mths and will take out many established small business retailers and small business service providers. Startups won't get out of the starting gate.</p>

<p>As a retailer you absolutely have to target growth of 20-50% YoY from here on out otherwise you will become one of the statistics. The established retailers and small business providers are now fighting for survival and they will play dirty to retain their revenue.</p>

<p>Even Magento &amp; eBay employees are now contacting us directly they are so worried about service provider free high growth strategies. We're off back to trading and our own commerce sites so will wait for the dust to settle around here - honestly hope some of you make it through because if you do you will gain 7-10x the customers from the failing retailers.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn't really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general - <em>love</em> learning, <em>hate</em> school.  It's great learning something new on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites every day.</p>

<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript (by far my most common for my answers on Stack Overflow)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>I've started off learning Python - it's slightly different to JavaScript but so far it's been surprisingly easy to use.</p>

<p>I find PHP rather horrid -- it's just too big of a mess to deal with and I abhor the giant blob of functions.  I wouldn't even recommend it for a newbie - not only is it rather dissimilar to other languages, you have to spend half your time reading the PHP manual to figure out what a method does, which cuts down on productivity and learning significantly.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages I'm learning now or considering to in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>(and if this doesn't take a decade) Haskell</li>
</ul>

<p>I've moved to HK just recently, originally from Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>I am a Development Manager / Project Manager / Software Architect / Software Engineer with decades of practical experience spanning a wide array of tools, technologies, and industries. I have strong technical skills and am equally comfortable in leadership or technical roles, but I am probably most valuable consulting, planning, and leading projects to successful completion. I am an exceptional problem solver and am great at finding innovative workable solutions to almost any challenge.</p>

<p>If your project is already running smoothly, then congratulations! You probably don’t need me. I am the guy you want when things are turning upside down, heading completely off the rails, and you are starting to pray for a miracle. Well, your prayers are answered. I am here to deliver your miracle—nothing supernatural—just good old-fashioned hard work, commitment, and grit. I am a fixer, a troubleshooter, a hands-on results-oriented manager—that guy you want to come in, take charge, and get the job done no matter what.</p>

<p>I want to take your broken processes, your bug-ridden software, your dysfunctional development team, your late project that just won’t seem to end, your impossible problem no one has been able to solve, or whatever other challenges you are facing, and I want to help you fix them.</p>

<p>I want to take those problems and make them my own—internalize them—obsess over them—grab hold of them with the same tenacity a Pitbull grabs onto the backside of a fresh new mailman. I won’t stop until we get-er-done. </p>

<p>I am a straight-shooting hard-charging high-energy go-getter. I prefer short duration high intensity engagements and thrive in chaotic fast paced environments. </p>

<p>If you are still reading, then it is probably because you’ve already decided I am “the one.” Great! We obviously have a lot of work to do. So, hand me my marching orders, and let’s roll up our sleeves and get started. I am ready to exceed your expectations, deliver concrete results, and turn you into the company hero.</p>

<p>I am not young enough to know everything. – JM Barrie's 1902 play ""The Admirable Crichton"" </p>

<p>The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits -Albert Einstein </p>

<p>What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. – Christopher Hitchens</p>

<p>Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see. – Arthur Schopenhauer</p>

<p>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish – Douglas Adams in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</p>

<p>42, the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. – Douglas Adams in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  (Adams responded thus: 'I may be a sorry case, but I don't write jokes in base 13.')</p>

<p>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.  – Teddy Roosevelt speaking at the Sorbonne a century ago in 1910. </p>

<p>A simple act of caring creates an endless ripple.  Pay it forward. – Anonymous</p>

<p>Shit happens to everyone - it's how you pick it up that counts. –  Nate Hill</p>

<p>Demonstrate to the world there is “No Better Friend — No Worse Enemy” than a US Marine. – General ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis</p>

<p>Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean that they aren’t after you. – Joseph Heller in Catch-22</p>

<p>No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. – to paraphrase Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</p>

<p>The future is not what it used to be. – Yogi Berra</p>

<p>A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone. – Henry David Thoreau, Walden</p>

<p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis</p>

<p>The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples' money.  -- British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher </p>

<p>How do you tell a communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin. - Ronald Reagan</p>

<p>It isn't so much that liberals are ignorant. It's just that they know so many things that aren't so. - Ronald Reagan</p>

<p>Everyone brings joy to this place.  Some, when they arrive.  Others, when they leave.  – Unknown</p>

With that said I also respect the fact that computers are made by people a lot smarter then me and that I don't know everything.  So I am often very cautious about messing with any part of a computer system that I am unfamiliar with or know holds important and delicate files/folders.  I am a quick learner and like to get as technical as I can while discussing a question or problem I have with a computer.  If you need to more than this just hit me up on Facebook (<a href=""http://facebook.com/xBaldingo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.com/xBaldingo</a>) and I would be more then happy to talk to you, just know that I don't keep anyone on my friends list that I don't actually consider a friend.  If you want to add me on there that's cool just know Ill take you off my friends list if we never talk.</p>

<p>Oh and I also try to be funny a lot and enjoy having as much humor in my life as I can.</p>

I have an interest in physics as it pertains to applications in engineering (mostly), as well an interest in mathematics as it applies to physics (also mostly).  I've found that it becomes easier to solve specific problems the more I understand the fundamental principles behind them, so my interest does extend somewhat beyond the application both.  It also doesn't hurt that I think they can be pretty fun by themselves.</p>

<p>As it stands now, my focus is probably going to be in electromagnetism, specifically antennas, microwave circuits, and communication systems.  I'm also interested in electronics, but without a stronger background in quantum mechanics (something that I'd love to achieve someday), I don't think that I'd be able to do as well as I'd like in that area.</p>

<p>I believe that science needs good public relations, just like any other social institution.  Scientists have the responsibility to follow the examples of Feynman, Sagan, Nye, and Tyson in the attempt to educate laymen and establish scientific thinking as the cornerstone of common sense.  Excellent spoken and written communication are central to that goal, and scientists/engineers should have a solid education in both.</p>

<p>The two scientists I personally feel the most affinity toward are Paul Dirac and Oliver Heaviside.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've worked for more than 13 years, designing products for web ventures, from 3-person initiatives to medium-large industry. Strong Presentation and Negotiation Skills have been key to this work (in addition to the full monte; infrastructure, database design, core algorithms, scaling, backed and frontend frameworks, test-ability, compliance, and UI/UX + SEO). </p>

<p>I also design technology &amp; products by drawing from a history of fabrication, prototyping, sourcing, and scientific research (applied physics).  I am a practicing sculptor, and establish new product aesthetics via my own approach to engineering fluid-mechanical processes.  From this work in water, I have built a broad &amp; deep knowledge-base on the application of fluid phenomenon to industry needs.</p>

<p>I have lead successful small-capitalization stages, wrote grants &amp; engaged program officers, developed teams and timelines, design of experiments, measurement, and business development.</p>

I have some interest in the workings of modern analytically based simulations that have been in the news from time to time, esp. in cancer research. ABM has similar as yet untapped potential as a means to explore macro scale systems as collections of emergent behaviors rooted in the collective behavior if micro scale agents.</p>

As proven by many studies, helping others reduces stress. Not only does stack overflow let you find a fast solution or hint towards a simple or trivial problem, but it also helps to relieve stress. Both when answering and asking question.
I usually <strong>de-stress</strong> by helping because the questions I have are usually already answered.</p>

<p>If you would like a chat you can usually find me on freenode in #php, #yii, #centos, etc,
 or in most channels on <code>irc.tbs-dev.co.uk</code></p>

<h3>Because I'm a landscaper/plant health care guy, here's a brief description of my local area and climate:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States </li>
<li><strong>USDA hardiness zone:</strong> 6b</li>
<li><strong>Frost dates:</strong> (1st frost) November 1st (last frost) April 30th</li>
<li><strong>Yearly Precipitation:</strong>  43.64 inches, avg</li>

<p>I have been gardening all my life, and have knowledge in lawn care, tree and shrub care, general landscaping, edibles, nursery, and indoor gardening, as well as other variable aspects of horticulture.</p>

<p>I also have a fairly good knowledge of basic biological concepts, and have fun learning about it on our [<strong>Biology</strong><a href=""http://biology.stackexchange.com"">2</a> site. I enjoy outdoor activities, such as horse riding, hiking, camping, etc, when I can get around to them. </p>

Through a strong foundation of knowledge and character, I am committed to the success and quality of the solutions I provide. I believe in cultivating a strong bond across the members of a project team with the goals of learning and a sense of shared purpose. I highly regard the relationship with clients, stakeholders and technical staff and strive to continuously grow and improve that relationship. </p>

<p>In the technical arena, I specialize in both front-end architecture, with a foundation on flexible, component-based views, and in back-end architecture, with a focus on service-based APIs. While I have no dedication to specific technologies, my most recent focus has been on Java solutions leveraging the Spring Framework. I've also implemented features on IBM platforms, including WebSphere Commerce and WebSphere Portal. The current list of frameworks I am regularly using include AngularJS, jQuery, Spring, Camel and Java. The primary databases I have been working on include Oracle and SQL Server.</p>

<p>My passions outside of my career include being a good husband and good father. I dabble in woodworking and have a love for sports, including baseball and hockey. I enjoy running and playing hockey.</p>

<p>I have got a PHD in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. I  teach Mathematics, Computational Methods, Financial Economics and Econometrics for economists.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I co-authored a book about Statistics applied to Finance and Economics (in Portuguese).</p>

<p>I am well versed in scientific programming, numerical methods, econometrics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and algorithm theory. I also have some knowledge of OOP and design patterns. </p>

<p>I learnt how to program in Pascal and Fortran. I also programmed in the past in OX and SAS. I admire the way SAS deals with large databases, but I do not like programming in it.</p>

<p>I have some experience in C++, JAVA, Matlab and Python. I really enjoyed programming in JAVA and I love programming in Python.</p>

<p>Although I had some real world experience in PHP, I consider myself a beginner. I worked few times with R (to run very specific things such as Negative Binomial regression of Type II), but I honestly I never liked the way it structures the things. </p>

I like to work/learn about algorithms, logic and architecture based stuff. I feel language is not a bar for a true programmer. Explanation is always better than just solution to copy. Sometimes on lengthy post, I like to inject comic and sarcastic lines in my answers. Just beware if you do not have the appetite to digest it, feel free to downvote any time. But upvote, if its helps :)</p>

  <p>The act of Programming is indeed thinking. The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.</p>

  <p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners.

  <p>Also: I really recommend to strike ""why don't they use X, yet"", ""why do they still use X"" and all variants thereof (regex: <code>(still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?</code>) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. ""Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know"" was something I heard quite often 10 years ago. It sounded like they seriously believed that .net was the One True Thing to use. Know what I mean? My newest favourite acronym fits nicely: <strong><code>A.S.S., Always Stay Skeptical</code></strong>.</p>

When things get tough, we can lean on our elders, the Slackers, and when documentation is needed, do we not consult the might force of Gentoo? We are a special breed of man. A breed that has broken free from our locks and chains. We have taken a road less traveled, and for it, we are persecuted. </p>

<p>It's a battle we constantly fight. We are tempted by the majority of the world and we bicker amongst our selves over silly things, but, in this year 19 Anno Linux, we have finally won. </p>

<p>A quote that a lot of us hold deep in our hearts was made by Ghandi, ""First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win."" It has taken 19 years, and we still aren't through this yet. We have been ignored, we have been ridiculed, we are currently fighting a war that is bigger than any of us. However, we are not alone. The pirates, the net neutralists, Google, Red Hat, Canonical, and to a degree, Apple, stand behind us. We share a common enemy, and together we will win.</p>

<p>But this is not a war that is won with violence, neither with words nor physical acts. I ask that you observe these three rules during this crucial time.</p>

  the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the
  steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:</p>

O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.

  <p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up—for you the
  flag is flung—for you the bugle trills; For you bouquets and ribboned
  wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding; For you they call, the swaying
  mass, their eager faces turning;</p>

<pre><code>Here Captain! dear father!
This arm beneath your head;
It is some dream that on the deck,

    You’ve fallen cold and dead.

  does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will; The ship is anchored
  safe and sound, its voyage closed and done; From fearful trip, the
  victor ship, comes in with object won;</p>

But I, with mournful tread,
Walk the deck my Captain lies,

<p><a href=""https://quickmediasolutions.com/flack/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flack overtstowed</a> has been appended. It should look appear as if you're using the selector, it should refrain from using inline JavaScript, it will be as tall as it to be the same size as it queries the DOM once more text. Inline elements will be vertically centered in reference to the parent element. There are much better to use <code>Event.preventDefault()</code> in the <code>Element.onkeydown</code> property and then check to see if that cookie is already set a translucent white background. Bootstrap >= 3.3.0 In Bootstrap version 3.3.0 there are CSS properties named overflow-y, overflow-x and simply overflow. In this case there is no reason not to. Are not selecting the submit button, you can select it using javascript. Create a new function to Check the width of the containing block. However, you can fake it. You can use display: table-cell and vertical-align: middle The vertical-align CSS property specifies the popover will be shown in front of the the image. This means that you're no longer hovering over the image, the popover will be overwritten by the subsequent rule as it queries the DOM once more information on corrections not specified in. This is a very simple thing to do. Find out what the original position of the div. If the scroll position is clicked, do nothing If the 2nd radio button is clicked, check the list items to display: inline-block and hide the overflow of .carousel. To achieve this effect, instead wrap the containing div element. This will happen. Note: This is does not necessary. Create two nodes 'node1' and script layout to make it more than the above solution. Apply the event listener to the image is hidden, which causes you can take advantage of another CSS properties named overflow-y, overflow-x and simply overflow. In this case there is greater then 768, set the variable at the beginning of the script like this to only execute the popover will be shown in front! You to be hovering over the image (to the bottom of the page). Use I'm not quite sure what that regex is supposed to do, but I am assuming that you're trying to only allow the background to continue across, wrap the container and apply the background color to the wrapper. One month's worth of milliseconds. insert a new div element with <code>display:inline-block</code> and <code>vertical-align: middle</code> then all of those elements using only CSS See the code corrections section below for more information on the client side, but first has to have a set height. What does that mean for maintaining aspect ratio? What this means is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, session?</p>

<p>Relevant Work Experience: 3 Months of an internship with The National Data Buoy Center located within NASA John C. Stennis Space Center. I made a MySQL database with a Java jdbc link which held buoy weather data. I created SQl statements on the front end which retrieved relevant weather data. I also used MATLAB to create charts and graphs about buoy positions and coordinates on Earth. I then presented my findings to all National Data Buoy Center employees. I learned much from the experience, including how to work around technology issues and how to work with coworkers of different skill sets.</p>

<p>In addition I have some experience with the following Languages: C++, C#, Python, R, JQuery, Javascript, HTML, and Assembly.</p>

<p>PhD concerning genre studies, and approaches to fantastic visual narrative (science fiction, fantasy, supernatural horror, surrealism).</p>

<p>Absurdly varied non-fiction library, and a constant struggle with my backlog of visual material to study.  Sometimes I even enjoy it.</p>

<p>Thinking about formulating a solid research project concerning fantastic narratives in audio media.  The cliché ‘The pictures are better on the radio’ is a cliché for a good reason.</p>

<p>Little-known fact: Anakin Skywalker turned to the Dark Side of the Force after a failed career as a restaurant critic. After a string of abrasive reviews -- ""The salt is strong with this one"", ""You have failed me for the last time, chef"" -- the last straw was when he had an affair with the editor-in-chief's college-age daughter (""Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is essential to a restaurant critic’s life. So you might say, that we are encouraged to love."") and aggressively trying to displace fellow critics (""Someday I will be the most powerful restaurant critic ever!"").</p>

<p>I went to Caltech for Applied physics, and have a great deal of Mechanical Engineering experience (and SolidWorks experience).</p>

<p>I have been using Debian since ""Slink"" was the stable version (1999-ish), and I have been administrating Linux networks since 2004 (fileservers, email, DNS, DHCP, IDS, IPTables, backups, LDAP+Kerberos).</p>

<p>Most of my programming experience is backend, primarily in scientific data analysis &amp; monitoring / automation. I prefer python as a language, but I am not a zealot. I find it is most pragmatic to use the right tool for the right job. I am also very proficient with C/C++ &amp; BASH. Additionally I have experience writing code for clusters using PThreads &amp; OpenMPI. I have a bit of experience implementing TCP servers and clients for custom network applications as well.</p>

<p>My HTML / CSS experience is rather rudimentary. The web stuff I have done has mostly been webapps for internal business processes (Manufacturing, Quality Control, Data Integration, ect). I have done a lot with AJAX as well, though I prefer to use JSON rather than XML unless I really need the power of XML (for example: Defining Document Types, and Validating Documents).</p>

<p>I have used Django on quite a few projects, and I love it!</p>

<ul>
<li>It is really easy to setup.</li>
<li>It follows the MVC paradigm so there is great separation between program logic and the interface which makes Django projects very maintainable.</li>
<li>The built in admin interface saves a lot of time and leaves my clients with a very easy way to update the content of their site without needing to consult me.</li>
<li>I get to write my code in python instead of php!!! This is huge because time spent doing web work is not wasted gaining experience on a language that is a one trick pony!!!</li>
<li>I can use any of the extensive python libraries in my Django projects, which greatly reduces the amount of code that I need to write.</li>
<li>Django apps can be fairly modular (especially if attention is payed to build them that way) which makes them highly reusable in other projects. Think lego bricks...</li>
<li>If I ever hit bottle necks in the performance of python, it is trivial to write python wrappers for optimized C/C++ code (or any other language for that matter), thus allowing the C/C++ code to be used directly from inside Django.</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently do consulting/freelance work in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Automation &amp; Monitoring Systems</li>
<li>Fullstack Web Applications</li>
<li>Permaculture Design</li>
<li>Live Bee Removal</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking for a great Linux hosting provider geared toward developers with shell access, a bunch of ready-to-deploy apps, and awesome tech support? Check out <a href=""https://www.webfaction.com?aid=pigimal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebFaction</a>, my favorite alternative to the big hosting beasts. They run CentOS 7 x64, have datacenters around the world, and have a full suite of regularly-updated development and deployment tools. And did I mention they're cheap? My basic plan is just US$8.50/mo! Check out all these other <a href=""https://www.webfaction.com/features?aid=38824"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">features</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full control over shell access (multi-user capability), email, and DNS.</li>
<li>Python, Ruby/Rails, PHP, Java, Perl, shell scripts...</li>
<li>Ability to install whatever software tools you need, and execute long-running processes.</li>
<li>nginx and Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB...</li>
<li>&quot;<em>One-click</em>&quot; (actually, several clicks and some typing) installers for a whole bunch (and different versions) of popular applications like Django, Rails, WordPress, Drupal...</li>
<li>and a ton of other stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>I honestly don't know of any other hosting provider that has a similar product, and if one exists I can't imagine it's as cheap. No, I don't work for them, I'm just a very satisfied customer. Yes, those are affiliate links, if you sign up then I get a little kickback - no cost to you.</p>

-Travel
-Hobby robotics and other electronic-tinkering

<p>My profession is software development though I'm currently transitioning to more of a DevOps role.

It pains me to say that Stack Overflow's continued assault on the community has largely driven me away from contributing further. I never thought I'd say this about this place, but there you have it. </p>

<p>The community is what makes the network great and I'll probably continuing reading and commenting here and there as it's tough to go, and in the (increasingly shortened) times between between announcing the next terrible decision, I can still feel like it was what it used to be.

<p>The sum and bulk of what it's all about can be viewed here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/Cyberlusion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Cyberlusion</a></p>

<p>and here</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GitShield/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/GitShield/</a></p>

<p>Basically, I have a small team building and we're trying to create a technocratic society where scientists rule - not politicians. Due to the horrible state of our ecosystem our grandchildren might be the last generation before the next mass extinction. I'm trying to use all the funds available and all the technology available to restore the ecosystem and give men an edge through cyborization of the human body. This means a lot of investment into different technologies and projects.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a stepping stone for our society to finally change. Decentralization of both economy and political power can bring about a sustainable environment where green cities are controlled by computer algorithms, calculating everything to work in perfect synergy.</p>

<p>The charity I would receive from you would obviously go towards monopolization of political power and economies. Bitcoins tend to ""eat"" fiat currency and I tend to use that against the banking system. The rate of return of investments ranges from 30% to 800%. The more money the project will have - the more it can make to become self-sustainable.</p>

<p>At this stage even a single Bitcoin is great as I used to work as a stock market analyst and have been studying the market - my plan is solid but I need more backing since there simply is no time - hence why I hardly sleep. All my personal money is in the project - everything from cloud mining to currency exchange platforms and lending to other people to get commission back. It's ironic I'm behaving like a bank now but tough times deserve tough measures.</p>

<p>Contact me if you would be interested in being part of the project - as an investor, a specialist in one of the fields or anyone else for that matter.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>Hope you see I'm trying to save us all here,</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Igor Dunaev</p>

5760,1,2016-08-12T20:36:52.707,Felix Lu,2016-08-12T20:36:52.707,,"Chicago, IL, USA","<p>As a native southern Californian (one of the few who never tried surfing in the 31 years I lived there), I knew little about life in the rest of the country. Since 2005, I have also lived in North Carolina (Durham), Wisconsin (Madison), and Illinois (Chicago). While my academic training was as a scientist/engineer in electronic materials science, I have since branched out - mainly into business development and industrial or corporate engagement/outreach for universities. My perspective from having worked at a large company (The Boeing Company) and having co-founded a high technology startup; and having the good fortune to have worked with interesting and talented people, has, in hindsight, prepared me well for this type of culturally-interfacing job. Hobbies include music, ping-pong, volleyball (indoor), camping, and most recently (since 2014), ""scenario"" martial arts. </p>

<p>Let me pontificate a bit : I'm definitely not interested in traditional martial arts, though I do see its value - it's certainly useful if you have the time to dedicate (which most working adults do not). The problem with the so-called ""self defense"" aspects of many martial arts (and I've witnessed this first hand through the lens of my Krav training) is that they are not <em>modernly</em> contextualized, field-tested, and in many cases, not even stress tested. I'm a believer in drills (a.k.a katas), but only if they are contextually based. I've written a medium length document (30 or so pages) as a ""primer on effective self defense"", documenting what I think are the most relevant concepts and context, from what I'd like to believe is a data-based and scientific approach. I'm happy to share and get feedback on it - just ask! I've attended three different Krav Maga schools (2014-2019) reaching level 3 out of 5 comfortably, dabbled in BJJ, FMA (Kali and Martial blades concepts - and come to the conclusion that it's good for attacking and showing off, but not useful for defense unless the attacker is just scared off by your knife movement display), struggled over the idea of using a knife for self defense (coming to the conclusion that knives suck for self defense, but are great if you decide to kill someone - and then have to deal with the heavy legal ramifications), and have a mild obsession with the ideas of technique over strength. I'm not a big guy and don't see myself bulking up (it's a lot of time and work!), but I'd like to be able to defend myself, my family and friends if push comes to shove. So how do we approach this strategically? That's part of my ongoing struggle and discussion.</p>

<p>My name is Nikola Ivanov and I've been a full-time freelance web developer since 2013. Since then I've worked on probably more that 500 projects of various types and sizes: landing pages, static HTML/CSS/JS websites, PHP websites, Wordpress websites, Single page applications (VueJS, ANGULAR), NodeJS rest-apis...</p>

<p>I am a full-stack web developer that focuses on and loves ""everything Javascript"" (ES6, jQuery, VueJS, ANGULAR, Typescript, NodeJS etc). Other than Javascript, of course, I work with HTML and CSS and have strong understanding and experience building responsive, pixel-perfect and well optimized websites. I also code Wordpress themes and I prefer coding a theme from scratch so that everything is as minimal and as optimized as possible (I do not work with Visual Composers).</p>

<p><strong>How I work?</strong></p>

<p>Whether we are talking about small, medium or large projects, I pride myself in always giving my best to each project, paying attention to the smallest of details, which means that all of my websites are pixel perfect, fast-loading, responsive, built with optimized images (minimal file size), seo-optimized, HTML and CSS valid (with the minimum amount of cleverly coded and non-repeating, modular HTML and CSS / SASS, in order to ensure best possible semantics, readability and small load time).</p>

<p>I work efficiently, am a fast typist and respect deadlines (most of the times I deliver before deadline). I believe that communication is the key to finishing a project successfully, and I can say without a doubt that I have a strong level of understanding and speaking English language.</p>

<p>As I have stated before, I am a detail-oriented person so rest assured that the work done by me will be error free and will be following latest web industry standards and best practices and methodologies.</p>

<p>If you're looking for high quality work, please don't hesitate to contact me anytime!</p>

I enjoy programming in Ruby, J, C, and JavaScript, in addition to my own languages like <a href=""https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/stacked"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stacked</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/attache"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Attache</a>. When I'm up for the challenge (or feel like hurting my mind), I pick up <a href=""https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BF</a>.</p>

<p>Code golf is an interesting way to program recreationally. I personally enjoy code golf because it's basically one large test case for a language I make. After all, I believe a language is only as good as it can be short. (Thus Java often falls out of favor with me...)</p>

<p>Similarly, I heavily enjoy obfuscation. It's an expression of the mastery that one has in a language, and an art form in itself.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing video games (TF2 is love, TF2 is life), writing, reading, or (<em>gasp</em>) socializing within what semblance of a social life I have.</p>

<p>About <em>me</em>, I'm a Christian teenager, proud to be serving my God. I do what I can to let people know there is a God who loves them, without stepping on people's toes. I'm not shy about my faith, though I try not to flaunt it or greet people with a ""HeyhowareyoudoyouknowJesus???/??"", e.g.</p>

<p>Off of stack Exchange, I enjoy making music and listening to music 24/7. I also like rock climbing and video games. </p>

<p><em>On</em> Stack Exchange, I greatly enjoy using the worst possible language for the task. That's why I've written two different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/DJMcMayhem/V"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">V</a>, a golfing variant of vim that's only good at manipulating strings, but can do a bunch of other stuff if you have the patience.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/DJMcMayhem/Brain-Flak"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brain-flak</a>, a turing tarpit where simple tasks are obscenely difficult, and the only valid code is balanced brackets.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you ever need me for something, feel free to ping me in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte"">The Nineteenth Byte</a>, I'm basically in that room constantly. Or you can email me at <code>DJMcMayhem[at]gmail[dot]com</code>.</p>

<p>Many computers, operating systems, and programming languages later, I still enjoy writing software.  In those days, the code might have been to play a tune, a lunar lander clone or even a little hardware integration to turn on and off lights.  These days, I still dabble and explore in my own time.  Whether learning something for the job, or for a personal project.  The last few years of personal projects have involved Raspberry Pis, NodeJS, web/mobile development, and even building a CNC router.  </p>

<p>Over the course of my career, I've worked in many aspects of software development.  I started off in a professional services role, then into product development.  I built software for mid sized companies and enterprises, now I work within an enterprise class company. I have been in management for a decade, but I am now back into an individual contributing role as an Architect.  And, its not over yet.</p>

I teach at all university levels. In my department I am responsible for the research education and teach research methodology to PhD students. I am also Editor-in-Chief of an international ISI listed journal.</p>

<p>For Tex.sx: My history with LaTeX essentially started when I was introduced to TeX as a graduate student. I produced my thesis in a home (some would say half) baked TeX format. After a hiatus of some Word years I returned to LaTeX and have never looked back. I now try to implement all my documentation in LaTeX including university versions of beamer, beamerposter and letterheads (the U does not provide anything but Word templates). </p>

<p>LaTeX spawned my interest in type setting and I have spent time type setting books among others a popular science book on Glaciology. As Editor in Chief of an international journal I am working in collaboration with a professional LaTeX expert on implementing a LaTeX template for manuscripts and proof-ready layout. As head of graduate studies I am also trying to influence graduate students to work with LaTeX.</p>

<p>Recently moved back from South East Asia to Cape Town.</p>

<p>I'm a little bit of travel and workaholic.</p>

<p>After travelling on and off for four years I could never find things to do in the country I was going to visit.</p>

<p>Or I did not know about a solution to this at the time.</p>

<p>I could plan and check what it was like in the country by using www.nomadlist.com.</p>

<p>But never the things you see, visit, experience in the country/place in real time.</p>

<p>That's until I discovered www.vibescout.com <a href=""http://www.vibescout.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vibescout</a>, an app that did this in South Africa. I flew back to Cape Town a month later to help it grow.</p>

I started as a lowly customer service rep but felt inefficiencies everywhere so started to initially build tools in excel using VBA and VLookups.  Then I found myself using Salesforce and administrating that which lead me to want to program using Apex but Apex books seemed to require previous experience in real programming so I bought Java for dummies and read it from cover to cover in a weekend and started trying to code in Apex.  Then I embarked in trying to get my own project going which resulted in me learning angular and node.js... That was a limited path because of the SEO implications so I switched to learning React... Now I am a full stack developer by night and an admin/developer for the Salesforce platform by day.</p>

<p>Worked at the Fokker factory. Contracted myself out for measuring and modelling flying controls for all kinds of aircraft, fixed wing and rotary, military and civil. Wrote the physics model simulation software for them, and tuned on the simulator. Found myself in the cockpit of an F-111 with one jet engine running to power the hydraulics, wondering where the handbrake was situated which I did not want to inadvertently dislodge. </p>

<p>Sold and supported different bits of flight simulator, then sold complete civil simulators in Asia, then set up a business running them, contracting with airlines. Still doing bits of engineering just for the fun of it.</p>

<p>I very much enjoy the aviation site and have reconnected with many things I had learned decades ago, some of them half forgotten. Some awesome people here, taking time to write awesome answers.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>One day maths teacher came to class, and said, ""I am going to take a quiz today"". He did not see any surprised face,.... like everyone knew it! Two days later he brought the answer sheets, and was quite happy because most of them got 100% marks. Well, most of them... Some of those students could not even got 10% marks. Student who got 60-80% marks gathered around the teacher, asking what is wrong in their solution etc. <strong>And here I am</strong>, sitting at the corner of the room playing video games, because I know, teacher will call me after the class to warn me that I may fail in end of the semester, which I am not going to listen anyway...</p>

  <p>I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.</p>

He was interested in pursuing the role of a programmer because he wanted to progress and develop amidst the rapid advances in technology and information, not only as consumers but also as makers.</p>
<p>He is getting to know MS-DOS and Delphi at the high school level, since that time the desire to become an application maker that can benefit the wider community begins to grow. But the opportunity to continue their education to a higher level has not been obtained so he decided to work as a graphic designer at a printing company in Bali.</p>
<p>In Bali, the adaptation ability was formed because the educational background is completely different from the skills needed in the workplace. With a good work ethic and enthusiasm, for six years of service, able to meet the required qualifications and the opportunity to be appointed as a supervisor.</p>
<p>When he has the opportunity to continue his education, he chooses information technology to improve his understanding of programming. Programming languages ​​like C++, PHP, Java, and Visual Basic began to be recognized. This was done while working in a company engaged in publishing and printing as a layout designer and continued while working as a financial administration in a company's consumer needs.</p>
<p>After college, he worked as a data manager in a government office. Here, he was intrigued to develop his ability as a programmer so that his spare time was filled with learning Javascript [Ember JS, Node JS, and Express JS], Ruby [Ruby on Rails], and Python [Django].</p>
<p>He saw that some processes at work could be optimized so web-based applications were made using Ruby on Rails, the first application was made to optimize the process of making incoming and outgoing mail in the office which was able to reduce paper usage up to 500%. The next application was made to facilitate the process of collecting the files of Catholic teachers and instructors as well as providing a medium for sharing their information.</p>
<p>Then he got the opportunity to have a career as a programmer in his hometown, involved in developing hotel management and microservice applications, even though his range of services was short, he understood that documentation, communication, collaboration, and guidance from seniors was needed to develop the capabilities of a programmer.</p>
<p>Now he is actively participated in various activities in several developer communities to improve his ability in programming.</p>

In predominantly Islamic, Buddhist and Hindu countries, Dr. Youngren has seen crowds up to 600,000 gathers at one time.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Youngren</strong> has a fresh approach to communicating God’s love, as presented through Jesus Christ in the Holy Scriptures. Enabled by a unique friendship approach, Dr. Youngren has been granted permission to speak to some of the largest non-Christian audiences that a Christian speaker has ever been given.</p>

<p>Dr. Peter Youngren’s work has been widely recognized around the world, for a simple, yet profound presentation of God’s love for all people, no matter their faith or background. His work has included what many calls, “supernatural wonders &amp; healing”, however, Peter will never take any credit for himself. Instead, he always directs the attention to God’s love helping people.</p>

<p>Author of 8 books, including, “My Muslim Friends”, Dr. Peter Youngren has taken a timely, even historic approach, to helping people of all faiths discover God’s unlimited love for them in Jesus Christ. Muslims, Christians, Hindu, Buddhists, Atheists, and many other types of faiths, gladly listen to Dr. Youngren communicate in live events.</p>

<p>For over 40 years, in over 100 nations, Dr. Youngren has presented God’s love shown in the person of Jesus Christ, through numerous communication tools: books, Bible institutes, gospel festivals, leadership training seminars, churches, friendship dinners, worldwide TV productions, social media, and so much more.</p>

<ul>
<li>a Linux server admin (mostly SUSE - openSUSE and SLES - and some Red Hat - RHEL) of Testing, Development and Production servers (both physical servers and virtual machines - usually VMware) </li>

<p>My laptop and netbook also run Linux (namely Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The coding that I do is mostly in Perl and ""shell scripts"" (for the ""bash"" shell) for automating system administration tasks in Linux servers. In ""previous lives"", I coded web applications in PHP for LAMP based projects and also in ASP (""Active Server Pages""), both ""classic ASP"" - ASP + VBScript - and ASP.Net - using C#</p>

I currently am comfortable working in PowerShell and SQL and occasionally dabble in Python. I also learned HTML in college but didn't really enjoy it and no longer see the need for coding in it with today's advances in web developing. I hope to become a Windows-based Systems Administrator or some sort of Security Administrator during my career while working in a corporate environment. I also want to startup my own side business doing networking and hardware solutions and hope to eventually do that full-time (years down the road after I've gathered enough experience and knowledge in the corporate world.) Learning different languages and coding in them is essentially a fun challenge that I can mix in with everything else that I am working towards.</p>

<p>The start of my programming career came from my time served in the US Army. I was a 25U - <em>Signal Support System Specialist</em>.<br>
While my job was based more on networking &amp; radios and didn't really have much to do with programming, my AIT instructor was familiar with C+ and that's ultimately where I became interested in the subject.</p>

<p>Unless I explicitly state otherwise below, you must assume I have no expertise / formal training in any topic. This includes, but is not limited to, assuming I have any <strong>legal, medical, or structural engineering, electrician, or plumber training whatsoever. I have no such training, nor do I hold any certificates or accolades in the aforementioned</strong>.</p>

<p>If you take my advice and it ends badly, you do so <strong>at your own risk</strong> and I can provide <strong>no warranty or guarantee</strong> as to my advice's efficacy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>My advice is provided ""as is"". If you take my advice and it ends well, I am ""happy for you"", unless you are using the advice I have given to ""be a dick"", in which case I am at best ""ambivalent"". I do not understand why licenses feel the need to put ""as is"" in quotes, but I like punctuation (especially parentheticals and ellipses...), so I've decided to ""adopt"" that ""arbitrary style"" for the ""duration"" o""f"" ""this paragraph"".</p>

<h2>What I am</h2>

<p>I'm a computer engineer and computer scientist (with degrees 'n' everfin'). I wouldn't call myself an ""expert"" in any topic, but I like computers and am reasonably good at getting thinking machines to do what I want them to do. Currently working as an SRE at <code>$silicon_valley_company</code> writing Ansible and Salt deployments targeting cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>Personal opinion? After writing a <em>lot</em> of Ansible, I've reached the conclusion that no one should use Ansible. I've yet to come to a formal opinion about Salt.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>My favorite languages are bash, C, C++, Python, Verilog, Perl, and Haskell, but of those I'm only fluent in the first 6. I'm also fluent in Matlab (well... GNU Octave, really), Java and VHDL. And I like Scala better than vanilla Java- except when it comes to the collections framework- because mixins.</p>

<p>LaTeX is also fun, and I can use it wonderfully, but ``fluent'' implies I know a lot about the language constructs, which I don't, so I'm not.</p>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

<p>If it's an operating system whose name is a registered Bell of AT&amp;T trademark Corporation, or based on the aforementioned, I like it. Also like FreeBSD a lot (ran it on my main machine without a GUI for the duration of 2014). But I also quite like OSX. I know how to use Windows effectively, but that O/S is just too GUI-oriented to make me happy. And, no, Powershell doesn't solve the problem. If I wanted to write DCL, I'd be running VMS.</p>

<p>CentOS and Debian also float my dirigible quite nicely.</p>

Wright,2018-12-14T20:54:07.030,https://wrightfully.com,"Naperville, IL, United States","<p>Pragmatic senior .NET developer with experience across the development lifecycle and a passion for continuous improvement of product, process and self. <strong>I work here at Stack Overflow</strong>, but that doesn't mean anything I say is more than my own opinion unless I state otherwise.</p>

<p>See my <a href=""https://www.wrightfully.com/about"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website/blog</a> for more personal details. </p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have designed and built “shrink-wrapped” software as well as large, distributed, multiplatform network applications. My experience spans the entire software lifecycle: customer-facing requirements gathering, analysis, design, development, testing, release, and maintenance. I have successfully led teams to deliver software using pragmatic methods and continuous process improvement. Though I have experience in a manager role, I prefer to provide leadership through technical direction and mentorship.</p>

<p>I have a passion for high-quality, clean code. Whether through sharing my experiences with TDD approaches, mocking frameworks, and static analysis tools, or guiding less experienced developers through design patterns, SOLID principles, and the darker crevices of the .NET framework, I enjoy sharing my approaches with my peers and learning from their experiences -- helping everyone ""level up"" as a team.</p>

<p>My career experience roams around the Chatbot Industry, Healthcare Sector, Financial Sector, Automotive Industry, IT Service Industry, and startups. I worked on many scalable products, complex software and progressive web apps.</p>

<p>I have 4 years of experience in frontend technologies like Angular JS, React JS, Javascript, Jquery, HTML 5 &amp; CSS 3 and backend technologies like PHP, GO, MySQL, Mongo DB, and Redis.</p>

<p>I have around 2 years of experience in testing web apps based on Jest, Karma Jasmine, and Mocha test tools.</p>

<p>I also have 3 years of experience using CI/CD tools like Circle CI, Docker, Heroku auto build, GitHub, Gitlab, and bitbucket.</p>

<p>Simultaneously I have around 3 years of experience using AWS EC2, Route 53, S3 bucket, Amazon DNS, and Godaddy cloud.</p>

<p>My top 3 skills include Angular JS, Javascript, and React JS.</p>

<p>In angular JS I have worked on the electron, ionic, Cordova, angular 1, 4, 5, 6, angular classes, angular directive, pipes, services, components, caching, progressive events, NPM libraries, material design, and bootstrap design. For testing purpose, I prefer karma jasmine to test these apps. The best project I created in angular js a Chat based Dashboard and CRM. Where executives can do multiple tasks at a time like chatting, transfer the customer to another executive, auto reply based on artificial intelligence, auto-saving of the answer if doesn't available in our database etc.</p>

<p>In javascript, I have worked on socket, core, ECM 5, and ECM 6 coding standards. My best project for this is a Call Application for a BPO sector that processes around 1 million call records daily. For testing purpose, I prefer Qunit for javascript apps.</p>

<p>In Rest JS I have worked on React, React DOM, Distributed Classes, and Components etc. For testing purpose, I used Jest to test react web apps. The best project I created on this is a Green Energy Company CRM where I created around 50 different type of component.</p>

<p>Apart from this I also have good experience on PHP(Laravel), Go, Python(Django), Mysql, Mongo DB, and Redis database.</p>

<p>That’s All.</p>

</a>
<p>Moderator  ♦  on <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">English Language and Usage</a> and Pro Tem ♦ on <a href=""http://portuguese.stackexchange.com"">Portuguese Language</a>.  I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage"">ELU chatroom</a>.</p>

<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>

<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

<p>I specialize in enabling small-to-medium sized companies to scale up their development and delivery capabilities, with a focus on modern technologies including machine learning, service oriented architectures, and cloud based platforms. These are all typical of common application platforms which frequently have very large operational datasets and globally distributed customer base. </p>

<p>I take a holistic approach, focusing not only on the direct aspects of technology, but also ensuring that the marketing and business processes are properly aligned and that implementation and operation is cost appropriate.</p>

<p>With over twenty years of experience in the technology industry I have seen and done it all. I have worked at large public corporations and small start-up companies, presented at industry and technical conferences, and managed teams of people working on large projects with multi-million dollar budgets. I also have worked with educational institutions as both an instructor and an employer of students.</p>

<p>Aside from stuff pertaining to MSE, I'm also a regular contributor to GameFAQs (<a href=""https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/community/Eevee-Trainer/contributions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>), and run a Pokémon-themed community Discord server with over 6,000 members (<a href=""https://discord.me/eeveemd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">invite</a>). I also occasionally can be seen poking around other Stack Exchange sites (math is my specialty though), VGMaps, Pokémon Showdown, and spend a large time watching YouTube videos in a variety of STEM subjects or video games.</p>

<p>My education in mathematics thus far is mostly undergraduate-level stuff: I graduated in the spring of 2019, and am looking to pursue graduate school in the future. I also dabble in self-study and have my paws in a lot of STEM-related YouTube channels, so all told, while I have a long way to go in terms of mastering mathematics on a deep level, I certainly feel I have a fair breadth of knowledge ... and probably more interests in various fields of math than I'll be able to deeply pursue in my lifetime.</p>

<pre><code>Today I left my phone at home
And went down to the sea.
The sand was soft, the ocean glass,
But I was still just me.

Then pelicans in threes and fours,
Glided by like dinosaurs,
An otter basked upon its back,
And dived to find another snack.

The sun corpuscular and bright,
Cast down a piercing shaft,
And conjured an inspiring sight
On glinting, bobbing craft.

Two mermaids rose up from the reef,
Out of the breaking waves.
Their siren song was opium grief,
Their faces from the grave.

The mermaids asked a princely kiss
To free them from their spell.
I said to try a poet’s bliss.
They shrugged and bid farewell.

The sun grew dark and sinister,
In unscheduled eclipse.
As two eight-headed aliens
Descended in their ships.

They said the World was nice enough
But didn’t like our star.
And asked the way to Betelgeuse,
If it wouldn’t be too far.

Two whales breached far out to sea,
And flew up to the sky,
The crowd was busy frolicking,
And didn’t ask me why.

Today I left my phone at home,
On the worst day, you’ll agree.
If only I had pictures,
If only you could see.

Not everything was really there,
I’m happy to confess,
But I still have the memories,
Worth more than tweets and stress.

Today I left my phone at home,
I had no shakes or sorrow.
If that is what my mind can do,
It stays at home tomorrow.

Gavin Miller

8582,101,2019-05-05T21:13:48.013,Lisa Beck,2020-08-16T00:42:35.100,,,"<p>I don't often contribute to the English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange because the answers needed for the questions posed here are often well above my expertise and very often already answered by those whose credentials far exceed my own. Perhaps, with the proper education, training, and experience, I'll have something more to contribute down the road. As it is, I've asked more questions than I've answered and expect that trend to continue for some time.</p>

<p>If you've come to my profile because the question I asked or answer I gave made you curious about me, then I would imagine you'd be interested in knowing a bit more about my credentials, so here they are: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I'm a native speaker of English who has been immersed in the language since birth and have been speaking and writing in this language for more than three decades</strong></li>
<li><strong>4 years of English at a reputable, public, U.S. high school</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 year of Advanced Placement English</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graduation from the University of Washington, a reputable, public, state school that requires a certain number of English composition credits before graduating</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graduation from the Basic Journalism and Broadcasting courses at the Defense Information School</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I've never won any awards, but (and few people know this) ...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I did get a score of 4.0 (scale of 0–4.0) on one of my college papers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Other credentials: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>As a Combat Correspondent, I've
   had a few articles published in <em>Marines</em> magazine, the flagship
   publication of the United States Marine Corps</strong></li>
<li><strong>I've taken and passed the Graduate Records Examination (GRE).
Relevant scores are as follows: Verbal Reasoning: 160 (Rank Below:
84%) and Analytical Writing: 5.0 (Rank Below: 93%)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know if any of the above makes me qualified to answer any of the questions here, but I do want it to be known that I find no pleasure in contributing to a thread of answers unless I think I have a unique perspective to add and/or need to try to help correct something for the record of<br>
posted answers.</p>

<p>I do know that this is a great resource and that even if some of my answers seem a bit long-winded, it is not my intention to clutter up a thread with irrelevant, useless information. Even if I don't state this, I often read and reread a question as I attempt to answer it and the details in my answer are typically provided to either add support or evidence for any claims I make in my answer. Sometimes, though, details are included to to courteously, subtly, and indirectly counter what may be misleading information found in the thread or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Lastly, I realize that any skill I may have developed is merely a point on a spectrum and that if I'm doing things right, I will know more about my language tomorrow than I do today. A resource such as the English Language and Usage Stack Exchange will definitely propel me further along that spectrum, so thank you to all who take the time to contribute to it.</p>

BS Nguyễn Trọng Nghĩa năm nay đã bước sang tuổi 62, nhưng tinh thần hăng say công việc và ham mê nghiên cứu tìm tòi thì có lẽ vẫn như “mãi mãi tuổi 20”. Suốt gần 30 năm cống hiến với nghề thầy thuốc, có lẽ cuộc đời ông đã viết thành một cuốn nhật ký.</p>

<p>Từ cậu nghiên cứu sinh y khoa đến người thầy tận tâm</p>

<p>Nhận trên tay tấm bằng cử nhân Đh Khoa học năm 1977 cũng là lúc ông bước vào thời gian học tập 4 năm dài tại Đại học Y dược thành phố Hồ Chí Minh.</p>

<p>Năm 1985 xuất sắc trở thành một trong những sinh viên y dược cổ truyền ưu tú, ông được cử đi nghiên cứu sinh tại Học viện Y dược Bắc Kinh, Trung Quốc. Sau 3 năm tìm tòi, nghiên cứu và học tập tại “Cái nôi của nền Đông y cổ truyền  – Trung Hoa”, BS. Nghĩa trở về Việt Nam mang trong mình những khát khao lớn và cái tâm của người thầy thuốc.</p>

<p>Năm 1990 cũng chính là dấu mốc bắt đầu cho “cuộc đời áo trắng” của BS. Nguyễn Trọng Nghĩa khi ông trở về công tác trên cương vị giảng viên Y học cổ truyền tại Đại học Y dược Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh.</p>

<p>Ông chuyển về làm bác sĩ tại bệnh viện Y học cổ truyền TP. Hồ Chí Minh kể từ năm 2001 và luôn luôn giữ được danh hiệu thầy thuốc ưu tú tại đây trong suốt những năm công tác.</p>

<p>An Nam Dược – Bước ngoặt lớn của cuộc đời</p>

<p>Năm 2008, với sứ mệnh đem bài thuốc An Cốt Nam và nhiều phương pháp chữa nhiều bệnh như : trào ngược dạ dày, viêm loét dạ dày, viêm hang vị , đau dạ dày ,… tốt nhất đến tay người bệnh trên khắp cả nước. BS. Nghĩa và đội ngũ ban giám đốc công ty TNHH Tâm Minh Đường đã cùng nhau hợp tác thành lập công ty TNHH Nam An Dược – phòng chẩn trị YHCT An Dược tại khu vực phía Nam.</p>

<p>Ngày hôm nay khi đang giữ chức vụ giám đốc công ty TNHH Nam An Dược và là bác sĩ chuyên môn chính tại YHCT An Dược, PGS. BS. Nguyễn Trọng Nghĩa vẫn đang tiếp tục công cuộc điều trị cho hàng nghìn bệnh nhân ở Tp. Hồ Chí Minh và toàn miền Nam. Đây có lẽ là niềm vui, niềm hạnh phúc mà ông vẫn hằng hướng đến.
Hiện tại bác sĩ còn kiêm là cố vấn nội dung của Thoát vị đĩa đệm (<a href=""https://thoatvidiadem.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://thoatvidiadem.net</a>) website thông tin sức khỏe, đặc biệt là về các bệnh xương khớp thoát vị đĩa đệm, thoái hóa cột sống thắt lưng cổ, đau thần kinh tọa, viêm khớp, đau xương khớp, đau vai gáy, đau lưng,... </p>

If you have <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/help/whats-reputation"">enough rep</a> to chat (<a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/faq#talk"">20 network-wide</a>), you can ping me there.

<p>I haven't maintained these in a few years.

After 6 years of doing manual labor (wood cutting and later roofing) I finally decided, to do what I loved since I found out about it - programming.</p>
<p>(September 2018) I was lucky enough for a company called 8000plus d.o.o. to hire me without any experiences or knowledge, just based on my personality and whom I presented myself as - an enthusiast who will programme with or without them.</p>
<p>(March, 2019) I've gathered loads of experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP and JS, but the more I know, the more I see how clueless I am. As I develop web application I further develop myself and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>(July, 2020) SO. MUCH. TO. LEARN. I've been using ECMAScript6+ for the last half a year, and dropped jQuery completely. Also improving my understanding and usage of Three.js library. PHP-wise I'm adopting the latest versions (currently 7.4) and eagerly awaiting PHP 8. Last but not least mentioning-worth skill I'm improving on is Laravel 6 (with no prior knowledge). Oh, and I keep forgetting my projects in Xamarin.Forms (XAML, C#) - I make them work, but not really sure how. Oops.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll remember to update this description every year.</p>

Several of my software 'products' have been published in high-ranking, peer-reviewed journals, and are widely used throughout the international academic community: See, for example: <a href=""http://www.plantcell.org/content/29/11/2921"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On-Guard</a> and <a href=""http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/177/4/1368"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EZ-Rhizo</a>.</p>

<p>Almost all my programming is in C++, and mostly for the <em>Windows</em> platform; <em>Visual Studio</em> (using MFC) is my preferred development environment, though I am in the early stage of experimenting with porting code to <em>MacOS</em> (Xcode/Cocoa).</p>

<p>I have been programming for over 25 years! However, in the last year or so I have decided to 'get up to speed' with the latest developments in C++, like the Standard Template Library, smart pointers and C++17 (and maybe even C++20, at some point).</p>

<p>One mega-popular downtown Asheville restaurant is Hemingway’s Cuba. Hemingway’s Cuba strives to serve authentic Cuban food and provide its guests with a unique restaurant experience. The founder of this restaurant in Asheville, Tony Fraga, is from Havana, Cuba and most recently went back in 2016 to gather new ideas to bring his downtown Asheville restaurant to life. The famous author, Ernest Hemingway, frequented and favored the restaurant, which led to its name – Hemingway’s Cuba. Hemingway’s Cuba is a special downtown Asheville restaurant because it overlooks the Blue Ridge Mountains, which makes it the perfect scenic view. The authenticity and culture of Hemingway’s Cuba create a welcoming environment for all patrons.</p>

Let's suppose you have a limited budget for your car, which is less than current MSRP, but don't know which dealer can get you the car in your budget. So you start calling every dealer - asking them if they can give you the car in your budget. This process will take your valuable time. With Nedny's new system, just enter your information and request - the system analyzes it and automatically connects you with a dealer! Nedny have connected thousands of customers with dealers since they've launched 2 months ago and got them approved for auto loans with no credit at all!

But maybe you don’t have the time to go out to the bars and try your luck. Or perhaps you’re sick and tired of playing the game of online dating with Tinder or OkCupid (sometimes trying to fuck on dating apps can require the same level of time and effort as trying to go out and get laid anyway).</p>

Let's suppose you have a limited budget for your car, which is less than current MSRP, but don't know which dealer can get you the car in your budget. So you start calling every dealer - asking them if they can give you the car in your budget. This process will take your valuable time. With Nedny's new system, just enter your information and request - the system analyzes it and automatically connects you with a dealer! Nedny have connected thousands of customers with dealers since they've launched 2 months ago and got them approved for auto loans with no credit at all! If you have a bad credit, limited monthly budget or completely new credit, use <a href=""https://lowandnocreditcarfinance.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://lowandnocreditcarfinance.com/</a> to get your dream car!</p>
